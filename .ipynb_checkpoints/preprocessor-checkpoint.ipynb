      "â the wonderful who had been sobbing in the night he had a plan in which he really believed to say to her please let me help you princess like i was a knight at last he heard her moving about he rushed downstairs and waited on the stoop when she came out she glanced down and smiled he was sure that she expected to see him there but all his plan of assistance vanished as he saw her impatient eyes and her of dress â another tight fitting gown of smoky gray with faint silvery lights gliding along the fabric she sat on the rail above him immediately and answered his cheerfully he wanted so much to sit beside her to be friends with her but he felt it took courage to sit beside her she was likely to stare at him however he did go up to the rail and sit kicking his feet beside her and she did not stare instead she moved over an inch or two glanced at him almost as though they were sharing a secret and said quietly i thought quite a bit about you last evening i believe you really have an imagination even though you are a â i mean so many don t you know how it is oh yes you see mr didn t know he was commonplace after i left here last night i went over to and she dragged me off to a play i thought of you at it because there was an imaginative butler in it you don t mind my comparing you to a butler do he was really quite the person in the play y know most of it was rotten it used to be a french farce but they sent it to sunday school and gave it a nice fresh frock it seemed that a gentleman had been trying to make a match between his nephew and his our mr ward the ward personally i think it was by art but anyway the uncle knew that nothing brings people together so well as the same person you know like the cousin when you re a the cousin that always keeps her nails clean p yes that s jo so he turned nasty and of course the nephew and ward tiu death did them which i m very sorry to have to tell you death wasn t decent enough to do on the stage if the play could only have ended with everybody s funeral i should have called it a real happy ending mr laughed gratefully though he knew that she had made jokes for him but he didn t exactly know what they were the imaginative butler he was rather good but the rest that must have been a funny play he said politely she looked at him and confided will you do me a favor oh yes i ever been married he was startled his no sounded as though he couldn t quite remember she seemed much amused you wouldn t have believed that this superior woman who tapped her fingers carelessly on her slim exquisite knee had ever sobbed in the night oh that wasn t a personal question she said i just wanted to know what you re like don t you ever collect people i do â em quite cruelly and pin their poor little out on nice clean â you live alone in new york do you y yes who do you play with â know not â not much of anybody except maybe carpenter he s assistant for the it he meets a temperament company he had wanted to and immediately not to invent whereof he was an intimate what do â oh you know â people in new york who don t go to parties or read much â what do they do for amusement i m so interested in types well said he that was all he could say till he had a pair of thoughts just what did she mean by types had it something to do with stories and what could he say about the people he observed oh i don t know â just talk about â oh cards and and folks and things and â oh you know go to moving pictures and and go to island oh sleep but you r well i read a good deal quite a little shakespeare and geography and a lot of stuff i like reading and how do you place she gravely desired to know â you know â the german oh yes â â let me see now he s â why you remember don t you and he wrote the great musical comedy of the century and did the music â and i haven t been to it he said vaguely i don t know much german course i know a few words like dutch and y sir that at the company â he s a german jew i guess â learnt me but say isn t great when i read i can imagine i m along one of those roads in india just like i was there â you know all those and so on s wonderful ain t it um yes i bet you read an awful lot very little oh â d and some our mr and a little â â that last was a joke you know oh yes what sorts of plays do you go to mr moving pictures mostly he said easily then bitterly wished he hadn t confessed so low life a habit well â tell me my dear oh i didn t mean that artists use it a good deal it just means old chap you don t mind my asking such personal questions do you i m interested in people â and now i must go up and write a letter i was going over to s â she s one ,9\n",
